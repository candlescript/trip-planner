                        Egyptian Chicken Sofrito is a comforting dish featuring braised chicken, potatoes, and onions. Skinless chicken pieces, typically dark meat, are browned alongside sliced onions. Cubed or wedged potatoes are often fried for a crispy exterior before joining the pot. A simple braising liquid made with oil, lemon juice, and sometimes water or broth simmers everything together, infused with warm spices like turmeric and cardamom. Variations might include additional vegetables or a touch of spice, and vegetarian options often replace chicken with chickpeas or lentils. This flavorful one-pot meal is perfect for a satisfying and easy dinner.
