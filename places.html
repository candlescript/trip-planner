                <div class="description">The Pyramids of Giza are a group of three pyramids and several associated buildings, located on the Giza Plateau in Egypt, on the outskirts of Cairo.  They are considered some of the most remarkable engineering achievements in human history. The oldest and largest of the three pyramids is the Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), which was built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu during the 4th dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. It is estimated to have been built over a 27-year period and is made up of over 2.3 million blocks of stone, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons.</div>

                <div class="description">The Great Sphinx of Giza, a legendary monument right next to the famed Pyramids of Giza, is an awe-inspiring testament to ancient Egyptian civilization. This giant statue, carved from a single piece of limestone around 2500 BC, depicts a mythical sphinx – a creature with a lion's body and a human head (often resembling a pharaoh). Standing at an impressive 240 feet long and 66 feet high, the Sphinx was likely built as a guardian for the pyramids and a symbol of the pharaoh's power and divinity. The weathered exterior and missing nose of the Sphinx add to its mystique, leaving its exact origins and the reasons behind the damage shrouded in mystery.</div>

                <div class="description">•	Imposing Presence: Built between 1830 and 1848, it's the largest mosque constructed in the first half of the 19th century and remains one of the most visible landmarks in Cairo.
                    <br>•	Architectural Inspiration: Muhammad Ali Pasha aimed to showcase a new era for Egypt. The mosque's design drew inspiration from the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul, reflecting a shift away from the Mamluk architectural style that dominated Egypt before his rule.
                    <br>•	Ottoman Influence: The mosque exemplifies Ottoman architectural features, with a large central dome, four half domes, and twin minarets – the tallest in all of Egypt. The extensive use of alabaster stone on the interior walls and exterior panels earned it the nickname "The Alabaster Mosque."
                    <br>•	National Mosque Ambitions: Originally intended to be the national mosque of a newly independent Egypt, the Muhammad Ali Mosque stands as a symbol of Muhammad Ali Pasha's modernization efforts and his desire to assert Egypt's place on the world stage.
